              This year marked the completion of my second application developed in .NET Core, a significant milestone following my initial foray into application development during my university's Advanced Programming Master Course. This project served as a personal endeavor, crafted diligently during evenings and weekends outside of office hours. My aim was to showcase proficiency in TypeScript coupled with React for frontend development, complemented by ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework for backend database management. Over the past two years, my journey has been immersed in code, navigating through extensive documentation across diverse technologies, and mastering the intricacies of full-stack application development and cloud deployment. This immersive experience has broadened my perspective of the software landscape, compelling me to embrace continuous learning. I actively engage in coding, devouring relevant documents and blogs, and seek guidance from seasoned professionals, enriching my understanding and expertise with each endeavor.

            This year marked the beginning of my journey as a software engineer at Fishbone Solutions in Derby. One of my key achievements was spearheading the development of the company's inaugural commercial application—an Engineering Change system, replacing the outdated EMR system for our client. The positive feedback received from EMR opened doors to new opportunities for our software team. Leveraging a full-stack approach, I utilized cutting-edge technologies such as React, Redux, and Bootstrap for the frontend, while employing Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM for robust backend functionality. Additionally, I implemented Auth0 for seamless authentication across the company's systems, extending its benefits beyond the EMR application to any other cloud-deployed applications within the company's ecosystem. The success of this project fuels my enthusiasm to further enhance my skills; I've begun immersing myself in TypeScript to bolster application reliability. Concurrently, I've embarked on exploring application development in the .NET core, discovering its rich array of services and features that empower developers like never before.

            At this year I graduated from university with the dissertation about
            the comparison between two unsupervised algorithms (Generative
            topographic map and Self-organizing map) to see which one of them
            shows the variants of participants stress level by taking thier
            heart rate variability data and show it on a 2D map(my dissertation

              PhD thesis </a
            >at Northumbria University). After graduation, with all I had
            learned from my degree, I still wanted to expand my knowledge in
            computer science. I asked myself which field I need to learn more
            about? Well after searching and asking my classmates I decided to
            expand my knowledge in the field of web development. Since then I
            did a lot of freelance projects in web development. I started to do
            basic projects with only HTML and CSS. Then I added my Javascript
            knowledge on top of that. I learned how to use DOM and APIs with
            Javascript so I can build powerful web applications. After that I
            leanrned React framework so I have even more power with my frontend
            web design.

          <h4>2021</h4>
          <p>
            This year was the second year of my University and I found myself in
            a positon to choose a topic for my advanced practice semester. I
            knew I want to do a project related to machine learning so I
            contacted some of the university lecturer to discuss my situation
            and what would be the best option for me. At the end I got a project
            in unsupervised learning algorithm which was about designing a 2D
            map of heart rate data in order to show participant's stress level.
            I found this project challenging in a constructive way. I learned
            how to collaborate in a team and how enormous is the power of data
            graph when it comes to understand something with visualization.

            This year the corona virus effected everyones life and I was not an
            exception! I found myself in a challenging position where my degree
            modules were hard enough to take all of my energy, I also needed to
            deal with the situation of corona virus. Nevertheless I learned a
            lot from materials in my modules. I learned how to design a desktop
            application with .NET framework and how to design a database for my
            application.

            This year I started to learn about computer science and as I learned
            more about it, I felt more confident that this field is something I
            really enjoy! I became very curious to know how computers made such
            a huge impact on human life since 1960 and I found myself in a
            position that I was searching in about different topics about
            computers. This curiosity has been increased since then!
